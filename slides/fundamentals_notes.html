<aside class="notes">
<p>
So given the agreed goal of sustainable development, we need to have
some quantitative measure of sustainability.
</p>

<p>
Our values guide the manner we behave.  Similarly, the methods by
which we value resources (e.g., clean water and air, minerals, fossil
fuels, solar insolation, etc.) profoundly influences the ways in which
we choose to conserve or exploit them and even affects what we
consider as a resource.
</p>

<p>
The economic or monetary value of a resource provides a useful measure
by which everything can be compared on a "uniform", quantitative
basis.  It accounts for many factors, including the benefit of using
the resource, the difficulty of its usage, its availability and
demand, etc.  However, by its intrinsic nature, it is largely
subjective and susceptible to manipulation (e.g., speculation in
commodity markets, changes in government policy, etc.).
</p>

<p>
The use of concepts, such as carbon foot print or energy usage,
provide a useful indication of sustainability, however, these
typically only address a specific issues, such as climate change, in
limited circumstances and do not easily generalize to situations where
multiple factors may be important (e.g., comparing the relative
benefits of using nuclear power or the quantifying the relative
advantages of recycling over waste to energy through incineration).
</p>

<p>
Measures of sustainability
</p>


<p>
These ecological footprints can be traced back to the idea of carrying
capacity of land.
</p>

<p>
Each of these measures only applies to a particular aspect of
environmental impact.
</p>

<p>
What is required of a good measure of sustainability?
</p>

<p>
The monetary cost provides a robust, transferable quantitative measure
of environmental impact.  It reflects our ability to enact change,
which
</p>

<p>
Thermodynamic approaches offer an objective and "universal" measure of
the value of resources and the cost of various processes, through the
concept of lost work or free energy.  The value of a resource is
directly related to its "work" (exergy) content, and the cost of a
process is the amount of lost work it incurs.  Thermodynamic
approaches have been used successfully to assess and improve the
sustainability of industrial processes.  However, a purely
thermodynamic analysis has many shortcomings.  For example, there is
no consideration of the worth of time, such as the loss of value of
resources that degrade or the time requirement for transformations to
occur.  In addition, they do not consider the availability and
efficiency of technologies to perform particular transformations
(e.g., if there is not technology available to extract it).

It is extremely difficult to directly manipulate entropy.  In
practical situations, temperature is usually a variable that is more
natural for us to control.  We can swap the entropy for the
temperature as an independent variable by performing a Legendre
transform.  If we define the Gibbs free energy \(G\) as the energy minus
the product of the temperature and entropy and add to it the product
of the system pressure and volume, then we find the following
inequality.
</p>

<p>
The natural independent variables of the Gibbs free energy \(G\) are
the temperature, pressure, and species amounts.  
</p>

<p>
If we hold the temperature, pressure, and material in the system
constant, then find that the change in the Gibbs free energy of the
system is always less than or equal to the amount of non-expansion
work that we extract from the system.
</p>

<p>
This definition of the free energy is not unique.
</p>


<p>
A system always tries to decrease its free energy.  The maximum work
that can be extracted from a system is its free energy loss.  The
minimum work required to perform a non-spontaneous transformation is
the free energy gain.

<p>
As a first example, let us consider the work content of a hot cup of
coffee.  Let's assume that the cup contains 250 mL of coffee and take
its initial temperature to be 60^&circ; C and the temperature of the
surrounding air to be 20^&circ; C.  If left alone, we know that the
coffee will eventually cool to 20 C, coming to thermal equilibrium
with the surrounding air.  Using the properties of water, we estimate
that the coffee will release a total of 42 kJ.  
</p>

<p>
The cooling of the coffee is a spontaneous process, which will occur
on its own.  According to our analysis, however, we know that this
provides an opportunity to extract useful work.

<aside class="notes">
<p>
If we get in the way of the natural cooling of the cup of coffee, then
we can extract work from it.  As an example, we can use Stirling
engine.  By forcing the heat released from the coffee to pass through
the engine before dissipating into the environment.
</p>

<p>
Not all the heat passing through an engine can be converted to work.
This fraction is known as the efficiency of the engine.  The maximum
theoretical efficiency is given by the Carnot cycle, and it depends on
the temperature at which the heat enters the engine and the
temperature in which the engine releases the unused heat.  The larger
the temperature differential, the greater the theoretical efficiency.
</p>

<p>
Let's assume that our Stirling engine has the maximum theoretical
efficiency.  The Stirling engine receives heat from the hot cup of
coffee, and it rejects the waste heat that it does not convert to work
to the surrounding air.  As the coffee cools, the temperature at which
the Stirling engine receives heat will slowly drop, and as a result,
its efficiency will decrease.  Therefore, to determine the total
amount of work that can be extracted over the entire cooling process,
we need to integrate the efficiency with respect to the temperature of
the coffee.
</p>

<p>
This leads to the final expression here.  We recognize the first term
in the expression for the work as the total enthalpy change of the
coffee due to cooling.  As mentioned previously, this is about 42 kJ.
The second term is the portion of this heat that cannot be converted
to work, due to the second law of thermodynamics.
</p>

<p>
For our 250 mL cup of coffee that started at 60^&circ; C, we find that
we can potentially extract about 2.6 kJ of work, which is only about
6.3% of the heat released by the coffee.  To put this into context, a
AA alkaline battery contains about 14 kJ of energy.  So we see that
five or six of these cups of coffee would be about the same as a
single AA battery.
</p>

<p>
In this analysis, we assumed that the Stirling engine ran with the
maximum thermodynamic efficiency, so 2.6 kJ is the most we could ever
expect.  The formula that we derived is applicable to any substance
with a constant heat capacity and can be used to estimate its work
value.  This is known as its thermal exergy and is only a property of
the state of the material and its surroundings.
</p>

<p>
In reality, the true efficiency will be less than this, due practical
issues, such as friction in the moving parts of the engine, loss of
heat from the sides of the engine, and other factors.  It has been
quoted that the efficiency of low temperature differential Stirling
engines is about a third of the Carnot efficiency.  There are other
engines that can be used to extract work from heat, such as
thermoelectric generators, each with their own efficiencies and
optimal range of conditions in which they work.

<p>
In the previous example, we demonstrated that work can be extracted
from the natural cooling of a hot cup of coffee.  If we just let the
coffee cool by itself, then we will have lost all that potential work.
Exergy is lost every time a transformation is allowed to naturally
occur without trying to extract work from the process.  One example of
this is the transfer of heat between two fluid streams in a
counter-current heat exchanger.

A hot liquid stream with a mass flowrate \dot{m}<sub>H</sub> and a heat capacity

So now we have built a little intuition on the concept of exergy,
let's consider a simple question that highlights the difference
between exergy and energy.  We want to deliver hot liquid water at
100^&circ; C, and we are given the choice of either starting with warm
water at 60 C or ice at -20 C.

<h2 id="org93a7370">Warm water or ice: Exergy analysis</h2>
<img src="../figures/exergy_water.png" style="margin-right:5px" height="300">

<aside class="notes">
<p>
To get a clearer perspective of the problem, we plot the exergy of
water as a function of temperature.  The black curve is the exergy of
liquid water.  When the water is at ambient temperature, its exergy is
zero, since it is at thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, and no
work can be extracted from it.  As the temperature of the water
increases from the environmental temperature of 20^&circ; C, its exergy
increases.  This is expected, as it takes work to heat water.
</p>

<p>
The black dotted line represents the exergy content for water at 60 C,
and the red dotted line represents the exergy content of liquid water
at 100 C.  So the minimum work required to heat liquid water from 60 C
to 100 C is given by the distance between the red dotted line and the
black dotted line, which is about 28.4 kJ/kg.
</p>

<p>
What might be somewhat unexpected is that the exergy of water
increases as we cool it below ambient temperature.  We can understand
this if we take into account that it requires work to refrigerate
things.  So the work it takes to cool water below ambient temperature
can be thought of as being stored in it as exergy.
</p>

<p>
The black curve continues to increase as the liquid water is cooled,
until we reach 0 C, where it will start to freeze.  The solid blue
curve shows the variation of the exergy of ice with temperature.  Note
that there is a discontinuity between the black curve and the blue
curve.  This represents the work required to freeze water.
</p>

<p>
The exergy content of ice at -20 C is given by the blue dotted line.
The work required to convert ice at this temperature to liquid water
at 100 C is just the distance between the red dotted line and the blue
dotted line, which is roughly 9.8 kJ/kg.  This should be compared to
the 28.4 kJ/kg of work required for water at 60 C.  So in theory, we
see that using ice will use about only a third of the fuel required by
warm water.
</p>

<p>
While exergy analysis tells us that we can potentially save fuel by
using ice, it does not tell us how we can practically do this.  This
requires ingenuity on our part.  Working with the ice, we can use a
Stirling engine, as we did with the hot cup of coffee, to extract work
as it is melting.  In this case, however, the engine will receive heat
from the surrounding air and reject heat to the ice.  In principle, we
can run the engine until the ice fully melts and also while the
resulting melt water warms up from 0 C to the ambient temperature.
From there, we can then heat the water with a heat pump which is
powered by the work we obtained fro the melting of the ice.  If this
process is run at full thermodynamic efficiency, it will take the
temperature of the water up to over 80 C, where the blue dotted line
intersects the black line in the exergy plot.  Then, the remaining
required heating can be done through the use of additional fuel.

Although in the development of exergy which was presented in the
previous lecture, we did not explicitly mention multicomponent systems
or possible chemical reactions that may occur within a system, the
derivations are sufficiently general that they also apply to these
situations.
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate how we can analyze a system undergoing a chemical
reaction, let us consider the amount of exergy that can obtained from
the oxidation of methane, which is given by the following reaction
</p>
<div>
\begin{equation}
{\rm CH}_4 + 2 {\rm O}_2 \longrightarrow
{\rm CO}_2 + 2{\rm H_2O}
\end{equation}

</div>
<p>
In order to compute the exergy change, we need to determine the
enthalpy \(\Delta H_{\rm rxn}\) and entropy \(\Delta S_{\rm rxn}\) change
of this reaction.  Specifically, the exergy of reaction \(\Delta B_{\rm
  rxn}\) is given by
</p>
<div>
\begin{equation*}
\Delta B_{\rm rxn} = \Delta H_{\rm rxn} - T_0 \Delta S_{\rm rxn}
\end{equation*}

</div>
<p>
We can do this with data for the enthalpy and Gibbs free energy of
formation, such as that given in Table~\ref{tab:formation}.

In a previous lecture, we examined several examples where we estimated
the maximum amount of work that could be obtained from a system.
These calculations were ad hoc, meaning that we had to examine each
system individually, on a case by case basis.  There is also the worry
that perhaps we were not "clever" enough to think of a better way of
extracting the work.  In this lecture, we will develop a general
method of computing the maximum amount of work that can be obtained
from a process.  Along the way, we will introduce the concepts of
availability and exergy.

<p>
We have shown how to determine the maximum work that can be extracted
from a system which is interacting with its surroundings, including
materials flow streams.
</p>

<p>
What we want to do here is to use this
expression to determine the maximum amount of work that we can extract
from a system, which we will call its exergy.  This can then be used
to quantify the value of the system.
</p>

<p>
One manner to value a material is by the maximum amount of work that
we can extract from it, which is known as its exergy or availability,
and we denote this with the symbol \(\phi\).  A material's exergy
depends not only on its properties but also on the details of its
surroundings.
</p>

<p>
So let's consider a system that is at pressure \(p\) and temperature
\(T\), and is composed of a variety of species \(\alpha\) in amount
\(N_\alpha\).
</p>


<p>
To calculate the maximum amount of work we can extract from the
system, we consider a process where it exchanges heat, volume, and
material with the surrounding environment until it has the same
temperature, pressure and composition as the surrounding environment.
</p>

<p>
We divide this process into two distinct steps.  In the first step, we
exchange heat between the system and the environment, as well as
expand or contract the system so that its temperature and pressure are
equal to that of the environment.  During this process, no material is
exchanged between the system and the environment.  So its composition
will not be the same as the external environment.
</p>

<p>
In the second step, material is exchanged between the system and the
environment until the composition of the system is identical to that
of its surroundings.  This may involve chemical reactions of
components in the system.
</p>

<p>
This two step process divides the exergy into two contributions:
physical exergy, which corresponds to the work extracted from the
first step, and chemical exergy, which corresponds to the work extracted
in the second step.
</p>


<p>
Physical exergy:
</p>



<p>
chemical exergy
</p>


<p>
The maximum work \(\delta W\) that can be extracted from this system
when it undergoes some kind of change is given by this equation:
</p>

<p>
which is equal to the negative change of its internal energy Plus the
system environment pressure x the change in its volume - the system
environment temperature times the changing is entropy material Flows
in and out that's a various streams k then we also have this
additional term where are the actual additional work that we can
extract is given by the enthalpy of that stream - the environmental
temperature times the molar entropy of the stream times the amount of
the stream that is entering or exiting the system.
</p>







<p>
We want to determine the maximum amount of work
</p>


<p>
do now is to assign this work
of value to a specific system and in that manner
</p>


<p>
develop a manner to quantify the value of
a system or material by

<p>
However, we are interested in trying to assign
this potential to do work to a material.

In this lecture, we examine
</p>

<p>
One of the key points to take away is that work can, in principle, be
extracted from any process that occurs spontaneously (i.e., a process
that will occur on its own).  The maximum work that can be obtained
from this process is the decrease in the free energy.
</p>

<p>
The reverse is also true.  Non-spontaneous processes, that is
processes that will not occur by themselves, can be made to happen
by applying work.  The minimum amount of work that is required is the
increase in free energy.
